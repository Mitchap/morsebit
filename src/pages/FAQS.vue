          What do you call the style of your products?

        <p class="text-base mt-2">
          <span class="font-medium">MORSEBIT</span>'s design philosophy follows
          utilitarianism, which aligns with the techwear criteria where
          performance plays a huge role in defining the aesthetics of clothing
          and accessories.

        <h2 class="mt-4 font-semibold text-lg lg:text-xl">
          Why are <span class="font-medium">MORSEBIT</span>'s products
          expensive?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base mt-2">
          The products are artisanal-made and produced in small batches. The
          unconventional and experimental design, materials used, and
          construction of each product contribute to their respective prices.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4 font-semibold text-lg lg:text-xl">
          Why can't I place orders in the website?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base mt-2">
          We do not collect any form of data; hence, placing orders is not
          possible, and the website serves only as a showcase website.

        <h2 class="mt-4 font-semibold text-lg lg:text-xl">
          Do you ship nationwide?

        <p class="text-base mt-2">
          Nationwide shipping is possible. Shipping costs are covered by the
          buyer. Products will be shipped with J&T Express. Once the product has
          been shipped, you will receive a tracking number for your order(s).

          Why do your belts not have a size chart?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-base mt-2">
          Each belt is constructed based on client specifications for
          personalization that ensures a perfect fit.
